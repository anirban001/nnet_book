sophisticated algorithm <= simple learning algorithm + good training data


network which breaks down a very complicated question -
  does this image show a face or not - into very simple questions
  answerable at the level of single pixels.

It does this through a series of many layers, with early layers
answering very simple and specific questions about the input image,
and later layers building up a hierarchy of ever more complex and
abstract concepts. Networks with this kind of many-layer structure -
two or more hidden layers - are called deep neural networks.

It certainly isn't practical to hand-design the weights and biases in the
network.

network should automatically learn the weights and biases - and thus,
the hierarchy of concepts - from training data

Comparing a deep network to a shallow network is a bit like comparing a
programming language with the ability to make function calls to a stripped down
language with no ability to make such calls.
